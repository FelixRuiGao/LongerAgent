## `edit_file`

`edit_file(path, edits, expected_mtime_ms?)`

Apply a patch by replacing one or more unique strings. Each `old_str` must appear **exactly once** in the file — if it's not unique, provide more surrounding context.

**Single replacement:**

```
edit_file(path="{PROJECT_ROOT}/example.py", edits=[
  { old_str: "Hello", new_str: "Hi" }
])
```

**Multiple replacements in one call:**

```
edit_file(path="{PROJECT_ROOT}/example.py", edits=[
  { old_str: "Hello", new_str: "Hi" },
  { old_str: "World", new_str: "Earth" }
])
```

All edits must not overlap and are applied atomically.

**Append:**

To append content to the end of a file, use `append_str`:

```
edit_file(path="{PROJECT_ROOT}/log.txt", append_str="\nNew entry")
```

`append_str` can be combined with `edits` — all replacements execute first, then append:

```
edit_file(path="{PROJECT_ROOT}/example.py", edits=[
  { old_str: "v1.0", new_str: "v1.1" }
], append_str="\n# Updated to v1.1")
```

Supports `expected_mtime_ms` for concurrency safety. Prefer `edit_file` over `write_file` for modifications — it's smaller and safer.
